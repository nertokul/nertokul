## Hi there, I'm Nermin! 👋

I'm a frontend developer who loves crafting beautiful, accessible, and user-friendly web experiences.  
Currently based in Turkey 🇹🇷, and coding my way across the globe one pixel at a time.

## 💻 What I do

- 🎨 Turn designs into responsive, interactive websites
- ⚛️ Build smooth frontend experiences with React, Next.js, and more
- 🔧 Write clean, maintainable code (and occasionally forget semicolons)
- 🧪 Continuously learning—currently leveling up in C and Algorithms

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, C (Work in progress!)
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Material UI, Tailwind
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code, Figma, Zod, Axios, Postman

## 🤓 Fun Facts

- I speak code, English, Turkish, and occasionally to my laptop when things go wrong.
- I love working in multicultural teams—even if I'm the only foreigner, I bring my own flavor! 🌍
- I’ve been described as the “debug whisperer” and “CSS magician” (by myself, but still.)
